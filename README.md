# ðŸ¦Š The Fox Firefox Theme 

The whole idea in the beginning was to make a toolbar with an image that I liked,  
and that would go well with the homepage of the browser.  
Now it's a whole theme on it! ðŸŽ¨

## ðŸ”§ Installation

This theme uses **Firefox's `userChrome.css` and `userContent.css`** customization system.  
Follow the steps below to apply it:

### 1. Enable UserChrome and UserContent
1. Open Firefox and type: `about:config` on the address bar.
2. Accept the warning if prompted.
3. Search for:
   - `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets`
4. Set it to **`true`**.

### 2. Locate your Firefox profile folder
1. In Firefox, go to: `about:profiles`
2. Look for the desired user section **Root Dictory**.
3. Click **Open Folder**.

### 3. Create a `chrome` folder (if it doesnâ€™t exist)
Inside your profile folder:
- Create a new folder named `chrome`
- [Download the theme as a ZIP](https://github.com/Shr11mp/The-Fox-Firefox-theme/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)  
- Extract the ZIP and place **all its contents** inside the `chrome` folder, including **`userChrome.css`** and **`userContent.css`**.


Your structure should look like this:

```
/your-firefox-profile/
â””â”€â”€ chrome/
  â”œâ”€â”€ userChrome.css
  â”œâ”€â”€ userContent.css
  â”œâ”€â”€ theme-images/
  â””â”€â”€ other-theme-files...
```

### 4. Restart Firefox
Close and reopen Firefox.
Your custom theme should now be applied! ðŸš€

## ðŸ’¡ Notes
- If the theme doesnâ€™t load, double-check that the preference  
  `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets` is still set to `true`.
- Changes to CSS files require restarting Firefox to take effect.
- Make sure youâ€™re using a **compatible Firefox version** (some UI elements may differ between releases).
- Check your **operating system** (Windows, macOS, Linux), since some styles may behave slightly differently.
